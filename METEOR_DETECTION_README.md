# Meteor Project Detection Testing

The extension now only activates when a `.meteor` directory is present in the workspace.

## âœ… **Current Project (meteorLanguageServer)**
This project does NOT have a `.meteor` directory in its root, so the extension should NOT activate here.

## âœ… **Test Project (test-project/)**
The `test-project/` folder DOES have a `.meteor` directory, so when opened as a workspace, the extension SHOULD activate.

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Steps:**

### Test 1: Non-Meteor Project (Current)
1. The current workspace (meteorLanguageServer) has no `.meteor` directory
2. Extension should NOT activate
3. No Blaze features should work in HTML/HBS files

### Test 2: Meteor Project 
1. Open the `test-project/` folder as a new workspace in VS Code
2. Extension should activate and show: "Meteor/Blaze HTML Language Server activated for Meteor project!"
3. Open `imports/ui/mainLayout.html`
4. Should see Blaze syntax highlighting, completion, and hints

### Test 3: External Non-Meteor Project
1. Create a new folder without `.meteor` directory outside the workspace
2. Add HTML files with `{{expressions}}`
3. Extension should NOT activate
4. No Blaze features available

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Details:**

- **Activation Event**: `"workspaceContains:.meteor"` in package.json
- **Runtime Check**: `isMeteorProject()` function checks all workspace folders for `.meteor` directories
- **Dynamic Handling**: Listens for workspace folder changes and adjusts accordingly

## ðŸ“‹ **Expected Behavior:**

- âœ… Activates only in Meteor projects (with `.meteor` directory)
- âœ… Shows appropriate activation messages
- âœ… Handles workspace folder changes dynamically
- âœ… Falls back gracefully when no `.meteor` directory is found
